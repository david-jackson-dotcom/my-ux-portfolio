<h1>David Jackson</h1>

Product Designer & Strategist | "Fusing form and function"

<h3>My Philosophy</h3>

I am a strategic, multi-skilled designer who believes that great digital products are forged at the intersection of aesthetic rigor and technical feasibility. With over 20 years of experience, I prioritize hands-on execution and iterative prototyping to validate concepts and generate tangible impact.

<h3>Impact at Scale</h3>

My work is rooted in solving complex product problems for industry leaders:

<ul>
  <li>Systems Thinking: Engineered software interfaces and navigational systems for Intel and NIKE.</li>

<li>End-to-End Delivery: Built the "Cheese Finder" PWA, moving from initial strategy and market identification to a working, responsive final deliverable — in eight weeks.</li>

<li>Technical Literacy: I operate comfortably across Figma, Adobe/Affinity suites, and front-end environments (React/HTML/Tailwind/CSS), ensuring design fidelity from concept through launch.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Collaboration & Process</h3>

I thrive in high-intensity environments where writers, designers, developers, and strategists collaborate fluidly.

<ul>
<li>Strategy: Distilling user intent into actionable design rationale.</li>

<li>Prototyping: Prototyping early and often to de-risk product decisions.</li>

<li>Quality: Applying a "QA-first" mindset (honed at TinyPrints and Google) to every pixel and line of code.</li>

</ul>
